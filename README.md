## Getting Started

Here's my small app to see weather forecast for the upcoming days and see if the temperature will be extreme based on
your max temperature.

To launch the app, first:

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

To choose the city and the temperature threshold fill in the inputs at the top, to verify your selected city look at the
top right.
